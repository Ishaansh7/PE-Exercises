#POV:Imagine you are working on a social media platform that allows users to create and share content with their friends and followers. As part of the platform's messaging feature, you need to develop a functionality that enables users to reverse the order of their messages. This will add a fun twist to conversations and encourage creativity in expressing thoughts.
print("Welcome to the Message Reverser!")
n=(input("Please enter your message: "))

print("Thank you for your message.")
print("The reversed version of your message is: ")
print(n[::-1]) #input string is reversed
